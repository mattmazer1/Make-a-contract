## Create a contract for services

Create a contract and send it to the address of which is your client.\
The receiving address will be prompted to pay and once paid can choose when to distribute the funds.\
You can only create one contract per address.\
All funds are locked in a smart contract and distributed when necessary, eliminating the trust and scam issues faced with providers and clients.\
Make sure to have some Goerli Eth to test this dapp out!
